One of my first big projects !
It's a procedural mining game, heavily inspired by Motherload and Terraria built in Java. I used cellular automatas and perlin noise for the terrain generation. I had to write my own game engine for this since I didn't know any better back then...  If you feel like it you can built it yourself, sadly there is no browser version available (maybe for the better)
